## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built on Ola ride-hailing data.
The dashboard provides a **360Â° view of operations** including **bookings, revenue, cancellations, ratings, and vehicle performance**.

Ride-hailing platforms like Ola face challenges such as:

* High cancellation rates (both customer & driver side).
* Tracking revenue across multiple payment methods.
* Understanding customer & driver satisfaction.
* Identifying top-performing vehicle types.

This dashboard solves these problems by **transforming raw booking data into actionable insights**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Ola, like any ride-hailing platform, generates **huge volumes of data daily**. However, raw data without analysis does not answer critical questions:

* How many bookings were actually successful vs. canceled?
* Which reasons drive **customer or driver cancellations**?
* What is the **impact of different vehicle types** on revenue and distance traveled?
* How do **payment methods** contribute to total revenue?
* Are customers and drivers satisfied (ratings comparison)?

This project aims to **uncover these insights in a visual, easy-to-digest format** for data-driven decision-making.
